# ContextAwarenessToken
A New Token Embedding That Takes In Context Awareness

Sure, here is a ReadMe text for the Context Awareness Token:

**Context Awareness Token**

The Context Awareness Token (CAT) is a class that represents a token with context awareness. It can be used to represent words in a way that takes into account the context in which they appear. The CAT class has the following attributes:

* `embedding`: A vector representing the token embedding generated by the model.
* `code`: A vector representing the compact code generated by the quantizer.
* `ontology`: A vector representing the ontology mapping generated by the knowledge base.
* `independent`: A vector representing the context-independent component of the token embedding.
* `dependent`: A vector representing the context-dependent component of the token embedding.
* `category`: A string representing the category of the word as defined in the dictionary.
* `predicates`: A list of strings representing the predicates for the category of the word as defined in the dictionary.

The CAT class has the following methods:

* `__init__()`: Initializes the token with the given word, URL, and page content.
* `get_context()`: Gets the context of the word from the webpage content.
* `is_in_category()`: Checks if the word is in the specified category in the context of the sentence.

The CAT class can be used to implement a variety of tasks, such as:

* **Named entity recognition (NER)**: NER is the task of identifying named entities in text, such as people, places, and organizations. The CAT class can be used to represent words in a way that takes into account the context in which they appear, which can be helpful for improving the performance of NER models.
* **Semantic reasoning**: Semantic reasoning is the task of inferring new knowledge from existing knowledge. The CAT class can be used to represent words in a way that takes into account their meaning and the relationships between them, which can be helpful for improving the performance of semantic reasoning models.
* **Question answering**: Question answering is the task of answering questions about a given text passage. The CAT class can be used to represent words in a way that takes into account the context of the question and the passage, which can be helpful for improving the performance of question answering models.

The CAT class can be used to improve the performance of a variety of NLP tasks by taking into account the context in which words appear.

**Usage:**

To use the CAT class, you first need to create a context dictionary. This can be done by using the `create_context_dictionary()` method. Once you have created a context dictionary, you can use it to initialize CAT objects.

To initialize a CAT object, you need to provide the word, the URL of the webpage where the word appears, and the page content. The CAT object will then generate an embedding for the word, taking into account the context in which it appears.

You can use the `get_context()` method to get the context of the word from the webpage content. The context is returned as a string.

You can use the `is_in_category()` method to check if the word is in the specified category in the context of the sentence. The `is_in_category()` method takes the category name as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the word is in the category.

**Example:**

```python
import context_awareness_token as cat

# Create a context dictionary.
context_dictionary = cat.create_context_dictionary()

# Initialize a CAT object for the word "John".
cat_object = cat.ContextAwarenessToken("John", "https://www.example.com", "This is a sentence about John.")

# Get the context of the word "John".
context = cat_object.get_context()

# Check if the word "John" is in the category "person".
is_in_person_category = cat_object.is_in_category("person")
```

The CAT class is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the performance of a variety of NLP tasks by taking into account the context in which words appear.
